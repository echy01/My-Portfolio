#My Portfolio
Project Overview
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project was built as part of the PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, educational background, professional interests, and projects, designed to be a central hub for potential collaborators and employers to learn more about my journey and work in software engineering.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to present my capabilities in web development using HTML and CSS, demonstrating clean code, responsive design, and an elegant, user-friendly interface.

‚ú® Features
This portfolio includes the following key sections:

About Me: A brief introduction to who I am, my passion for technology, and what drives me.

Educational Background: Details of my academic journey, including a downloadable version of my CV.

Skills & Expertise: A comprehensive list of programming languages, frameworks, and tools I am proficient in, along with my development focus areas.

My Interests: Insights into what excites me about the tech industry and my professional interests, including community involvement and advocacy.

Featured Projects: A dedicated section highlighting my key projects (NyamaLink, AdoptASchool Platform, Echy Crochets) with brief descriptions and direct links to their GitHub repositories.

Contact Form: An easy way for visitors to reach out to me directly for collaborations or inquiries.

Animated Background & Particles: Subtle visual enhancements to create an engaging and modern user experience.

Sticky Navigation Bar: Ensures easy navigation between sections as the user scrolls.
